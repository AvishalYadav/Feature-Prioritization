**Project Overview**
AI-LMS Feature Prioritization Dashboard is a tool designed to help product managers and stakeholders in an AI-powered Learning Management System (LMS) make informed decisions about which features to prioritize for development. It uses a data-driven approach to evaluate and rank features based on several criteria.
Key Components
Feature Prioritization Model:
Purpose: To rank features based on their importance and feasibility.
Criteria:
Customer Impact: How much users value the feature.
Development Effort: The complexity and resources required to implement the feature.
Strategic Alignment: How well the feature aligns with the company's goals.
2. Streamlit Dashboard:
Purpose: To provide an interactive interface for visualizing feature priorities.
Components:
Priority Matrix: A scatter plot showing the relationship between development effort and customer impact.
Roadmap Timeline: A bar chart displaying the timeline for feature development.
Interactive Sliders: Allow users to adjust the weights of different criteria in real time.
How It Is Helpful
Data-Driven Decisions: By quantifying the importance and feasibility of features, stakeholders can make more objective decisions.
Resource Optimization: Helps allocate resources efficiently by focusing on high-impact, low-effort features.
Strategic Planning: Aligns feature development with business goals, ensuring that the most strategically important features are prioritized.
Justification of the "AI" Name
AI-powered features: The project is designed for an LMS that includes AI-driven functionalities, such as personalized content recommendations and adaptive learning paths.
Data Analysis: While the project itself doesn't implement AI algorithms, it supports AI features by prioritizing their development based on data analysis.
Potential for AI Integration: The framework can be extended to include AI models for predicting feature success or user engagement, making it a foundational tool for AI-driven product development.
Where AI Can Be Used
Predictive Analytics: AI models could be integrated to predict the success of features based on historical data.
User Behavior Analysis: Machine learning algorithms could analyze user interactions to refine the customer impact scores.
Automated Prioritization: AI could automate the prioritization process by learning from past decisions and outcomes.
Conclusion
This project serves as a strategic tool for managing the development of AI-powered features in an LMS. It provides a structured approach to feature prioritization, ensuring that resources are used effectively and that the most valuable features are developed first. While the current implementation focuses on data-driven decision-making, it lays the groundwork for future AI integrations that could further enhance its capabilities.
